# FindDefault: (Prediction of Credit Card Fraud)
## Problem Statement:
A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card or credit card information to make purchases or withdraw cash.

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. 

We have to build a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
## About the Dataset:
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
## Project Focus:
We're going to focus on the following steps in order to solve the problem of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions:
### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Analyze and understand the data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data by using Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations.
### Data Cleaning:
This might include standardization, handling the missing values and outliers in the data.
